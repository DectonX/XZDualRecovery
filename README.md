Dual Recovery for Xperia devices

==============

Run 'dualrecovery' to start building. It is menu driven for ease of use.

Currently supported are:

* Sony Xperia Z

* Sony Xperia ZL

* Sony Xperia Tablet Z

* Sony Xperia Z Ultra

* Sony Xperia Z1

The main device menu is split up in to 2 major parts, 'Build' and 'Recovery'.

The 'Recovery' choice allows you to compile the recoveries from source without breaking a sweat ;)
After building you can apply the 'private' patches. Make sure the patches are still compatible
with the newer built recoveries!

The 'Build' menu item has an 'all' option, which will allow you to grab the latest built and patched
without the compilation bits. It will also ask if you wish to increase the revision number and if
you wish to upload it... which obviously will only work if you have the correct password.

==============

For now all releases will be officially done by [NUT] a.k.a. xNUTx.
